This project presents \textbf{FeatherFind}, an innovative system for automated bird species identification using audio recordings. The system combines two deep learning models: a \textbf{bird sound detection model} based on modified \textbf{ResNet-50 architecture}, and a \textbf{species classification model} utilizing \textbf{EfficientNetB3} and \textbf{CNN-LSTM architectures}. The bird sound detection model achieved \textbf{82.97\% accuracy} with an \textbf{AUC score of 0.911}, effectively distinguishing bird vocalizations from ambient noise. For species classification, the \textbf{EfficientNetB3 model} demonstrated superior performance with \textbf{90.73\% accuracy} across \textbf{41 bird species}, outperforming the \textbf{CNN-LSTM model's 74.73\% accuracy}. The system employs \textbf{Mel-Spectrograms} and \textbf{Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC)} for feature extraction, with \textbf{genetic algorithm} optimizing model hyperparameters. Implementation includes a \textbf{mobile application} that enables users to record bird sounds, visualize audio waveforms, and map identified species' locations. This research contributes to \textbf{biodiversity monitoring} and \textbf{conservation efforts} in Nepal, where over \textbf{887 bird species} exist, including \textbf{168 threatened species}.

\chapter{Introduction}\label{sec}
Globally, the avian kingdom is vast, with over 11,000 species, showing nature's
complexity and evolutionary skill. This number, from the International
Ornithological Committee as of April 2023, shows the great bird diversity, with
each species having its own role and story.\cite{ioc_updates}

In Nepal, a country known for its rich nature and varied ecosystems, from the
lowland Terai to the high Himalayas, there are more than 887 bird species,
according to the Himalayan Nature organization. This is over 8\% of the world's
known bird species, a big number given Nepal's small size.\cite{himalayan}

Many of these species are endangered due to habitat loss, climate change, and
human activities. The National Red List of Nepal's Birds identifies 168
nationally threatened bird species, including 68 Critically Endangered, 38
Endangered, and 62 Vulnerable species, as detailed in a publication by the
Journal of Threatened Taxa.\cite{inskipp2017nepala}

The situation of these endangered species shows the need for conservation
efforts. Technologies such as audio recognition provide new methods for
identifying and monitoring bird populations. By analyzing bird sounds and
pictures, researchers can better understand species distribution, behavior, and
threats. These technologies not only help conserve endangered species but also
support broader biodiversity research.

\section{Problem Statement}
In Nepal, a hotspot of avian biodiversity, accurately identifying and
classifying bird species, particularly those that are endangered, is a critical
yet complex task. Traditional observation methods are limited by the vast
geographical and ecological diversity of the region, making it challenging to
monitor and protect these birds effectively. The necessity for precise
identification is paramount for conservation efforts aimed at maintaining
ecosystem balance. To address this, there is a pressing need for a method that
can overcome these constraints by leveraging advanced technologies capable of
distinguishing between the myriad of bird calls and songs, as well as visual
markers through image classification. Such a method promises to automate the
identification process, enhancing accuracy and efficiency in monitoring
endangered species.

% Implementing audio recognition and image classification technologies, however,
% raises several challenges, including the effective training of these systems to
% recognize the specific calls and visual markers of Nepal's endangered birds.
% This requires collecting and curating extensive datasets, a task complicated by
% the elusive nature of many species and the complex acoustics of their habitats.
% Additionally, integrating these technologies into conservation strategies is
% crucial for not just identifying but also protecting these species from various
% threats. A multidisciplinary approach, combining expertise in ornithology,
% conservation biology, machine learning, and environmental science, is essential
% to develop a robust system. Such a system could provide reliable data on
% species distribution, population trends, and habitat use, thereby informing
% targeted conservation actions and policies to preserve Nepal's rich avian
% biodiversity.

          For each identified bird species, the app offers detailed profiles
          that include scientific and
          common names, physical descriptions, and conservation status. It also
          provides audio and visual
          media for reference, along with information on the bird's behavior,
          diet, and typical habitats,
          enriching the user's understanding of the species.

\end{enumerate}

which are collected from various environments and feature a wide range of bird
species.
\section{Related Research}

The study\cite{gautam2023audio} "Audio Classifier for Automatic Identification
of Endangered Bird Species of Nepal" focuses on using deep learning techniques
to identify endangered bird species from audio recordings. The dataset,
collected from xeno-canto.org, comprises 2215 audio recordings of 41 bird
species, 38 of which are endangered. This dataset was expanded to 6733
recordings through 10-second audio splitting and Gaussian noise augmentation,
with 5407 recordings used for training, 639 for validation, and 687 for
testing. The methodology involved handling imbalanced class distribution
through data augmentation, employing Mel spectrograms and Mel-Frequency
Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) for feature extraction, and developing a custom
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and an EfficientNet model. The
hyperparameters of these models were optimized using a genetic algorithm. The
Mel spectrograms were created using Short-Time Fourier Transform, converting
amplitudes to decibel scale, and applying Mel filter banks to the spectrograms.
Similarly, MFCCs were derived by framing the audio signals, applying Discrete
Fourier Transform, logarithmic scaling, Mel scaling, and Discrete Cosine
Transform. The EfficientNet architecture utilized compound scaling for network
depth, width, and resolution. The findings indicated that the proposed approach
achieved satisfactory results in classifying the bird species. Model I, using
Mel Spectrogram and EfficientNet, achieved an F1-score of 79\%, while Model II,
using Mel Spectrogram and Custom CNN, achieved 64\%, and Model III, using MFCC
and EfficientNet, achieved 72\%. However, limitations include the relatively
small dataset size and the need for further enhancement in model robustness and
accuracy.
%Future enhancements could involve
% expanding the dataset, exploring additional feature extraction techniques, and
% incorporating more advanced deep learning models to improve classification
% performance.\cite{gautam2023audio}\\

Sevilla et al.\cite{sevilla2017audio} introduced an innovative approach to bird
sound classification with their study `Audio Bird Classification with
Inception-v4 extended with Time and Time-Frequency Attention Mechanisms'. The
datasets employed include various bird sounds, prominently from the
BirdClef2017 challenge, consisting of 1500 bird species recordings. The
methodology revolves around treating bird sound classification as an image
classification problem through transfer learning. The Inception-v4 model,
initially pre-trained on ImageNet, was adapted to process time-frequency
representations of bird sounds by converting these sounds into RGB images using
three log-spectrograms generated via fast Fourier transform at different scales
(128, 512, 2048 bins).The findings demonstrate that the model, termed
`Soundception', integrates time and time-frequency attention mechanisms
effectively, significantly improving classification accuracy. The results
highlight Soundception's outstanding performance, achieving a mean average
precision (MAP) of 0.714 in classifying 1500 bird species, 0.616 MAP for
background species, and 0.288 MAP for soundscapes with time-codes, making it
the top model in the BirdClef2017 challenge across multiple tasks. However,
limitations include the incomplete convergence of the model due to
computational constraints and the extensive GPU resources required for
training. The paper concludes with a discussion on future improvements, such as
exploring different scalable optimizations and incorporating stacked GRU layers
for better audio-to-image representation learning, underscoring the potential
of transfer learning from advanced image classification models to acoustic
domains.\\

The study, conducted by Chandu B et al.\cite{chandu2020automated}, outlines a
robust methodology for identifying bird species from audio recordings,
leveraging a combination of meticulously curated datasets and machine learning
techniques. The dataset was manually compiledThe working mechanism for bird
identification from audio utilizes the dataset compiled from Xeno Canto,
housing a diverse collection of avian vocalizations. Our methodology revolves
around the utilization of EfficientNet, a state-of-the-art convolutional neural
network architecture known for its balance between accuracy and efficiency.
The primary objective of this study is to achieve high levels of accuracy in
identifying a broad spectrum of 41 distinct bird species. Here lies the
detailed explanation of the methodology, from the working mechanism to model
training. from both local recordings and online resources such as
xeno-canto.org, which apart from bird songs also contains ambient noise and
human voices to simulate real-world conditions. Pre-processing techniques
including pre-emphasis, framing, silence removal, and reconstruction were
applied to the audio clips to enhance the relevant frequency components and
eliminate unnecessary noise, ensuring the purity of the dataset. Spectrograms
of these processed clips were generated and used as input for training a
convolutional neural network (CNN), specifically AlexNet, chosen for its high
accuracy in image classification tasks. Through transfer learning, AlexNet was
adapted to recognize bird species from the spectrograms, achieving a
classification accuracy of 97\% in controlled environments. However,
recognizing the variability of real-world conditions, the researchers retrained
the model with datasets containing ambient noise, achieving a real-time
classification accuracy of 91\%. Despite these promising results, the study
acknowledges limitations such as the relatively small size of the dataset and
the need for further tuning of performance parameters to improve robustness.\\

`An Ensemble of Convolutional Neural Networks for
Audio Classification' \cite{nanni2021ensemble} presents a comprehensive study on CNN classification
using different architectures, data augmentation techniques, and audio signal
representations, aimed at enhancing audio classification tasks across various
datasets. The study employs three datasets: BIRDZ, CAT, and ESC-50, each
offering unique challenges in audio classification. The methodology involves
training five convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with four audio
representations combined with six different data augmentation methods,
resulting in thirty-five subtypes of ensembles. The audio representations
include techniques such as the Discrete Gabor Transform (DGT), Waveform
Similarity OverLap Add (WSOLA), and Phase Vocoder. The data augmentation
methods encompass procedures like short spectrogram augmentation, random time
shift, and frequency masking. The CNN architectures are pre-trained models
fine-tuned with these augmented datasets to boost classification accuracy. The
findings reveal that the ensemble method outperforms standalone networks,
achieving 97\% accuracy on the BIRDZ dataset, 90.51\% on the CAT dataset,
andThe working mechanism for bird identification from audio utilizes the

training. 88.65\% on the ESC-50 dataset. The study also highlights that the
best-performing CNNs are VGG16 and VGG19, with DGT as the most effective signal
representation. However, the study acknowledges limitations, such as the
computational cost of training ensembles and the variability in performance
across different augmentation techniques.\\

`Analysis of bird call datasets sourced from
Xeno-Canto'\cite{wang2022efficient}  comprisies of 72,172 samples from 264 bird species in 16-bit wav
format with a 16 kHz sampling rate. The methodology involved preprocessing the
audio data to filter out low-frequency noise and normalize signal amplitude,
followed by generating Mel Spectrograms and Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients
(MFCCs) as inputs for deep learning models. The Mel Spectrograms were produced
using discrete Fourier transform (DFT), and the MFCCs were derived by applying
discrete cosine transform (DCT) to the Mel Spectrogram. The study employed
various metrics to evaluate the performance of these methods, including ROC
analysis to visualize model effectiveness. Findings indicated that the proposed
models showed significant promise in identifying bird species from their calls,
with improvements in classification accuracy compared to previous approaches.
However, limitations were noted, including potential biases in the dataset due
to uneven sample distribution across species and the challenge of background
noise affecting signal quality. Future work suggested enhancing noise reduction
techniques and exploring more sophisticated neural network architectures to
further improve model robustness and accuracy.\\

The study\cite{pahuja2021sound} by Pahuja et al. conducted an in-depth analysis
of bird species recognition through acoustic monitoring, utilizing a robust
dataset of bird sound samples, meticulously annotated and validated for
accuracy. The dataset, referred to as SD, comprises multispecies bird sound
recordings, each labeled with species name and sample ID, along with
corresponding metadata, providing a comprehensive foundation for model training
and evaluation. Methodologically, the research employed a spectrogram-based
feature extraction approach, leveraging Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) to
capture the intricate temporal and spectral characteristics of bird sounds.
This was followed by the application of a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
classifier to distinguish between different bird species. The findings reveal
that the proposed model achieved high recognition accuracy, with some species
being identified with perfect precision, recall, and accuracy (100\%), though
the performance varied across species, with a few showing lower recognition
rates (86.9\%) and precision/recall values ranging between 50\-75\%. The
results demonstrated an overall classification accuracy of 96\%, with
cross-validation accuracy standing at 81.4\%, highlighting the model's
robustness yet indicating room for improvement in generalizability across
diverse datasets. Despite the promising results, the study acknowledges several
limitations, including the variability in recognition accuracy among different
species and the potential influence of environmental noise on model
performance. Future work is suggested to explore feature and model fusion
techniques, integrate the model with cloud-based systems for real-time
recognition, and expand the dataset to include a broader range of bird species
to enhance the model's applicability and accuracy in practical scenarios.\\

The dataset used in this study\cite{carvalho2023automatic} comprises recordings
labeled by species from California and Nevada, USA. It includes 91 species,
with 30 audio samples per species, amounting to a total of 2,730 MP3 files. The
methodology adopted involves three main steps: pre-processing, feature
extraction, and deep learning modeling. For feature extraction, MFCCs were
obtained using the Python library python\_speech\_features, with parameters
such as sample rate, 13 cepstrum coefficients, 26 filterbank filters, and an
FFT size of 512. Mel spectrograms were extracted using the Librosa library,
employing parameters such as a sample rate, an FFT window size of 2048, a hop
length of 512, and 128 Mel bands. In the deep learning modeling, CNNs and LSTMs
were compared for their effectiveness in classifying bird sounds. CNNs
demonstrated superior training accuracy with Mel spectrogram features,
achieving 99.05\% and 98.76\% accuracy for 3-second and 1.5-second spectroThe
working mechanism for bird identification from audio utilizes the dataset
compiled from Xeno Canto, housing a diverse collection of avian vocalizations.
Our methodology revolves around the utilization of EfficientNet, a
state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architecture known for its
balance between accuracy and efficiency.The primary objective of this study is to achieve high levels of accuracy in
identifying a broad spectrum of 41 distinct bird species. Here lies the
detailed explanation of the methodology, from the working mechanism to model
training.grams, respectively. In contrast, LSTMs achieved lower training
accuracies of 75.85\% and 73.29\% under similar conditions.These results
highlight the superior ability of CNNs to leverage the spatial and
frequency-related patterns in Mel spectrograms for accurate bird species
classification.\\

Finally, the study\cite{lasseck2018acoustic}, 'Acoustic Bird Detection with
Deep Convolution Neural Network', presents a comprehensive study of DCNNs pretrained on ImageNet which have been used highly effective
for bioacoustic classification, with preprocessing and augmentation playing
crucial roles in model performance. The preprocessing pipeline typically
involves applying a shallow high-pass filter (Q = 0.707) with a 2 kHz cutoff,
resampling to 22,050 Hz, and extracting around 4-second audio chunks, which are
transformed into mel spectrograms with 310 mel bands (160-10,300 Hz). Further
processing includes removing extreme frequencies, normalizing power
spectrograms to decibel units, resizing to 224*224, and converting grayscale
spectrograms to RGB for compatibility with ResNet. To improve generalization,
data augmentation techniques such as jittering chunk duration, extracting
chunks from random positions, adding noise from unrelated audio files, and
applying random amplitude scaling are employed. Additional augmentations in the
frequency domain include frequency shifting/stretching, piecewise
time/frequency resizing, and color jittering (brightness, contrast, saturation,
hue). Among these, the most effective methods are noise addition from random
files, piecewise time and frequency stretching, and time interval dropout,
which enhance robustness by simulating real-world variations in bird
vocalizations.\\


\section{Research Gap Analysis}

    \caption{System Overview}\label{fig:system_overview}
\end{figure}
Our project leverages a mobile application to capture audio recordings, which
are then processed to identify bird species. The mobile app records the sound
and visualizes it with waveforms during the recording process. Once the audio
is captured, it is sent to our backend system for further analysis.

This model determines whether
the recorded audio contains bird sounds. If bird sounds are detected, the audio
is then forwarded to the bird species classifier model. The classifier
identifies the specific bird species present in the recording. If the bird sound detection model does not detect any bird
sounds, the recorded audio is labeled accordingly, indicating the absence of
bird sounds.

Upon successful classification, the system maps the identified bird species to
the location where the audio was recorded, utilizing the device's GPS data.
This approach ensures that only relevant audio recordings are processed for
species classification, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of the system.
The integration of Django, Django Rest Framework, and MySQL provides a robust
and scalable backend infrastructure to support the application's functionality
as shown in Figure \ref{fig:system_overview}.

\section{Working Mechanism for Bird Sound Detection}
      The bird sound detection process represents the initial filtering stage of our audio classification system, determining whether a given audio clip contains bird vocalizations. The mechanism follows a series of steps as shown in \ref{fig:working_bird_det}.This module uses a modified ResNet-50 architecture, pre-trained on ImageNet and fine-tuned for binary classification of bird sounds. By converting audio inputs into mel spectrograms, the model can effectively distinguish bird vocalizations from ambient noise and other.

      \end{figure}

      \subsection{Data Collection}
      The dataset used for the Bird Sound Detection Model includes two primary sources:

      \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Field recordings, worldwide ("freefield1010"):} This collection consists of 7,690 excerpts from field recordings around the world, gathered by the FreeSound project and standardized for research. The dataset is diverse in location and environment and has been annotated for the presence or absence of birds. The distribution of this dataset is shown in Figure \ref{fig:freefield1010 dataset}.
            \begin{figure}[h!]

      Instead of using the datasets separately, we merged them to create a single dataset comprising 15,690 audio recordingsâ€”7,710 without bird sounds and 7,980 
      with bird sounds. The merged dataset was then partitioned into training, testing, and validation sets in an 80:10:10 ratio, ensuring a comprehensive and 
      balanced dataset for model training and evaluation.

      \end{figure}         \newpage      

      \subsection{Data Transformation}
      To enhance the robustness and generalization of our bird sound detection model, we applied a series of transformations on both the raw audio signals and 
      their corresponding Mel Spectrograms. These transformations include:

      \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Add Gaussian Noise (Raw Audio):}\\
            This transformation adds Gaussian noise to the raw audio signal. The noise is generated with a specified mean and standard deviation, and it is added to the audio signal with a certain probability. This helps in making the model robust to noisy environments.
            \begin{equation}
            \text{noise} = \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)
            \end{equation}

            \item \textbf{Random Volume Scaling (Raw Audio):}\\
            This transformation scales the volume of the raw audio signal by a random factor within a specified range. The scaling is applied with a certain probability, making the model resilient to variations in recording levels.
            \begin{equation}
            \text{audio} = \text{audio} \times \text{gain}
            \end{equation}
            
            \item \textbf{Time Stretch (Raw Audio):}\\
            This transformation stretches or compresses the time axis of the raw audio signal by a random factor within a specified range. The transformed audio is then converted into a Mel Spectrogram, which helps the model to handle variations in speed.
            \begin{equation}
            \text{audio} = \text{TimeStretch}(\text{audio}, \text{rate})
            \end{equation}
            
            \item \textbf{Frequency Masking (Mel Spectrogram):}\\
            This transformation masks a portion of the frequency bins in the Mel Spectrogram. The maximum number of frequency bins to be masked is specified, and the masking is applied with a certain probability. It encourages the model to focus on different frequency components.
            \begin{equation}
            \text{mel\_spec}[f:f+\text{max\_mask}] = 0
            \end{equation}

            \item \textbf{Time Masking (Mel Spectrogram):}\\
            This transformation masks a portion of the time frames in the Mel Spectrogram. The maximum number of time frames to be masked is specified, and the masking is applied with a certain probability. This helps the model to focus on various temporal features.
            \begin{equation}
            \text{mel\_spec}[:, t:t+\text{max\_mask}] = 0
            \end{equation}

            \item \textbf{Random Content Mixing (Mel Spectrogram):}\\
            This transformation mixes the Mel Spectrogram with another randomly selected noise Mel Spectrogram. The mixing ratio is chosen randomly within a specified range, and the mixing is applied with a certain probability. This aids in making the model robust to background noises.
            \begin{equation}
            \text{mel\_spec} = (1 - \text{mix\_ratio}) \times \text{mel\_spec} + \text{mix\_ratio} \times \text{noise\_spec}
            \end{equation}

            \item \textbf{Time Interval Dropout (Mel Spectrogram):}\\
            This transformation randomly drops intervals of time frames in the Mel Spectrogram. The number of intervals and the width of each interval are chosen randomly within specified ranges, applied with a certain probability. This helps the model to cope with missing or corrupted audio segments.
            \begin{equation}
            \text{mel\_spec}[:, t:t+\text{width}] = 0
            \end{equation}
      \end{itemize}

      \subsection{Feature Extraction}
      The Mel Spectrogram transforms raw audio signals into a time-frequency image that captures the essential spectral characteristics required for bird sound detection. As demonstrated by Lasseck et al.\cite{lasseck2018acoustic}, this approach efficiently distinguishes recordings containing bird vocalizations from those without. For a comprehensive explanation of the computation, please refer to the \ref{sec:feature_extraction}.

      \subsection{Model Architecture}

      The bird sound detection model utilizes a pre-trained ResNet-50 architecture as a feature extractor, which has been modified to process mel spectrogram representations of audio signals. This section provides a detailed explanation of the ResNet-50 architecture and the modifications applied to adapt it for bird sound detection.

      \subsubsection{ResNet-50: A Detailed Overview}\\
      ResNet-50, or Residual Network-50, is a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) designed to overcome the vanishing gradient problem that commonly arises in deep networks. It achieves this through the use of residual learning, where shortcut connections (skip connections) allow gradients to bypass certain layers, ensuring efficient training even in very deep architectures.
      \begin{itemize}
            % \subsubsection{Architecture of ResNet-50}
            \item[i)] \textbf{Architecture of ResNet-50} 
            ResNet-50 consists of multiple convolutional layers arranged into residual blocks. These blocks introduce identity mappings that help the model learn transformations efficiently. The network follows a hierarchical structure where initial layers focus on low-level features such as edges and textures, while deeper layers extract high-level representations.

            The architecture is composed of four main stages, each containing bottleneck residual blocks. Each block consists of three convolutional layers: a \(1\times1\) convolution for dimensionality reduction, a \(3\times3\) convolution for feature extraction, and another \(1\times1\) convolution to restore dimensionality. By utilizing these bottleneck layers, ResNet-50 maintains computational efficiency while preserving representational power.

            Another key component of ResNet-50 is batch normalization, which standardizes feature maps at each layer, leading to stable gradient flow and faster convergence. Additionally, ReLU activation functions introduce non-linearity, allowing the network to learn complex patterns in the data.

            \begin{figure}[h!]

            \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{images/MajorProject-resnet architecture.png}
            \caption{Modified ResNet-50 architecture for Bird Sound Detection.}
            \label{fig:resnet50}
            \end{figure}
            \newpage

            % \subsubsection{Components of ResNet-50 Architecture}
            \item[ii)] \textbf{Components of ResNet-50 Architecture} \\
            The ResNet-50 model consists of several esential components that contribute to its powerful feature extraction and classification capabilities:

            \begin{itemize}
                  \item \textbf{Convolutional Layers:} These layers apply convolution operations to extract spatial features from input images. Early layers capture basic features (edges, textures), while deeper layers learn more abstract patterns.
            
                  \item \textbf{Batch Normalization:} This technique normalizes activations at each layer to stabilize training, improve convergence, and prevent internal covariate shifts.
            
                  \item \textbf{ReLU Activation:} A non-linear activation function that introduces sparsity and helps the network learn complex representations.
            
                  \item \textbf{Residual Blocks:} The defining characteristic of ResNet, these blocks contain skip connections that allow gradients to bypass certain layers, mitigating the vanishing gradient problem.
            
                  \item \textbf{Bottleneck Layers:} Each residual block consists of three convolutional layers: a \(1\times1\) convolution to reduce dimensionality, a \(3\times3\) convolution to extract features, and another \(1\times1\) convolution to restore the original depth.
            
                  \item \textbf{Global Average Pooling:} Reduces the dimensionality of feature maps before passing them to the final classification layer, making the network more efficient.
            
                  \item \textbf{Fully Connected Layer:} The final layer of the network that performs classification based on extracted features.
            
                  \item \textbf{Softmax/Sigmoid Activation:} Applies a probability distribution to the output for classification, with softmax used for multi-class classification and sigmoid used for binary classification.
            \end{itemize}

            % \subsubsection{Adaptation for Bird Sound Detection}
            \item[iii)] \textbf{Adaptation for Bird Sound Detection} \\
            While ResNet-50 is originally designed for image classification, it can be adapted for processing spectrograms, which are visual representations of sound frequencies over time. In this model, several modifications have been applied to tailor ResNet-50 for the bird sound detection task (see Figure~\ref{fig:resnet50}):

            \begin{itemize}
                  \item \textbf{Input Modification:} Since spectrograms are typically represented as grayscale images with a single channel, the original ResNet-50 architecture, which expects three-channel RGB images, has been adjusted to accept single-channel inputs. This allows the network to effectively process spectrogram data without requiring redundant channels.
            
                  \item \textbf{Feature Extraction:} The pre-trained ResNet-50 model, trained on large-scale image datasets, is used as a feature extractor. The earlier layers remain unchanged, as they capture fundamental patterns useful for various classification tasks. These convolutional layers are frozen, meaning their weights are not updated during training. This strategy ensures that the model benefits from pre-learned visual features while focusing its learning on the final classification task.
            
                  \item \textbf{Modified Classification Layer:} The original fully connected classification layer of ResNet-50 has been replaced with a custom classification head optimized for binary classification (presence or absence of bird sound). This new layer stack introduces additional non-linearity and dropout mechanisms to prevent overfitting, ultimately improving the modelâ€™s ability to generalize to new data.
            
            \end{itemize}

            % \subsubsection{Training and Generalization}
            \item[iv)] \textbf{Training and Generalization} \\
            By freezing the early convolutional layers and training only the newly added classification layers, the model efficiently learns to distinguish bird sounds from other environmental noises. This transfer learning approach significantly reduces the training time and the amount of labeled data required, making the model robust in real-world scenarios.

            The final model is designed to process mel spectrogram inputs and produce a probability score indicating the presence of bird sounds. The use of residual learning allows for deep feature extraction, making the model highly effective in distinguishing between subtle variations in audio patterns.
            
      
            % \subsection{Training Process}
            \item[v)] \textbf{Training Process} \\
            The training process for the bird sound detection model was carefully designed to ensure optimal learning and generalization. The process incorporated several key components and strategies:
            \begin{itemize}
                  \\
                  \item \textbf{Training Parameters:}

                  \item \textbf{Loss Function:}
                  Binary Cross-Entropy Loss (BCE) was chosen as the loss function due to its effectiveness in binary classification tasks. For input predictions $\hat{y}$ and true labels $y$, the BCE loss is calculated as:
                  
                  % here

                  \begin{eqnarray}
                        L_{BCE} = -\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}[y_i\log(\hat{y}_i) + (1-y_i)\log(1-\hat{y_i})]
                  % \end{equation}
                  \end{eqnarray}
                        where N is the number of data samples.

                              \end{itemize}
                        \item Learning rate scheduling was implemented using ReduceLROnPlateau with:
                              \begin{itemize}
                                    \item Reduction factor: 0.1
                                    \item Patience: 3 epochs
                              \end{itemize}
                  \end{itemize}

                  \item \textbf{Monitoring and Validation:}
                  \begin{itemize}
                        \item Training and validation losses were monitored each epoch
                        \item Learning rate adjustments were made based on validation loss plateaus
                        \item Early stopping was implemented to prevent overfitting
                        \item Model performance was evaluated on the test set after training completion

      \subsection{Evaluation}
      To assess the effectiveness of our model in distinguishing between the target classes, we analyzed its performance using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. Following the benchmark established by Lasseck et al.\cite{lasseck2018acoustic} for the freefield1010 and warblrb10k datasets, the Area Under the Curve (AUC) metric was chosen as the primary evaluation criterion.

      The ROC curve provides a comprehensive visualization of the model's discriminative ability by plotting the True Positive Rate (TPR) against the False Positive Rate (FPR) at various classification thresholds. For our binary classification task:

      \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{True Positive Rate (Sensitivity):}
      \begin{equation}
            TPR = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}
      \end{equation}
      Measures the proportion of actual bird sounds correctly identified.

      \item \textbf{False Positive Rate (1 - Specificity):}
      \begin{equation}
            FPR = \frac{FP}{FP + TN}
      \end{equation}
      Represents the proportion of non-bird sounds incorrectly classified as bird sounds.
      \end{itemize}
      The Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) provides a single scalar value representing the model's overall classification performance. An AUC of 1.0 represents perfect classification, while 0.5 indicates random chance performance.

      The ROC curve analysis reveals several important aspects of our model's performance:

      \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Threshold Independence:} The ROC curve demonstrates the model's performance across all possible classification thresholds, providing a more robust evaluation than single-threshold metrics.
      
      \item \textbf{Class Imbalance Handling:} Unlike accuracy, the ROC curve remains effective even when dealing with imbalanced datasets, making it particularly suitable for real-world bird sound detection scenarios.
      
      \item \textbf{Operating Point Selection:} The curve enables the selection of optimal decision thresholds based on specific requirements for sensitivity versus specificity in deployment scenarios.
      \end{itemize}

      The high AUC score indicates that our model effectively separates bird sounds from background noise and other environmental sounds, making it reliable for real-world applications in bird sound detection.

            \caption{Block diagram for the working mechanism for Bird Species Identification}%\label{fig:fig1}
        \end{figure}
        The working mechanism for bird identification from audio utilizes the dataset
        compiled from Xeno Canto, housing a diverse collection of avian vocalizations.
        Our methodology revolves around the utilization of EfficientNet, a
        state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architecture known for its
        balance between accuracy and efficiency.

        The primary objective of this study is to achieve high levels of accuracy in
        identifying a broad spectrum of 41 distinct bird species. Here lies the
        detailed explanation of the methodology, from the working mechanism to model
        training.
        \subsection{Data Collection}
        For the bird species classification model, we scraped audio data from Xeno-canto
        (\textit{xeno-canto.org}), a global repository of bird vocalizations
        contributed by ornithologists and birding enthusiasts. Since the dataset was
        highly imbalanced, we applied a series of preprocessing and augmentation
        techniques to ensure a more uniform distribution across bird species.
        \begin{figure}[h!]

            \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{images/before_augmentation.png}
            \caption{Dataset before performing augmentation}
            \label{fig:visualization}
        \end{figure}
        
        \subsection{Data Augmentation}
        Initial analysis of the collected data revealed significant class imbalance,
        with some species having over 400 recordings while others had fewer than 50.
        Additionally, the audio recordings varied in length. To address these issues:

            \caption{Dataset after performing augmentation}
            \label{fig:visualization}
        \end{figure}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Audio Clipping:}
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Recordings were clipped into segments of 10 seconds each.
                    \item Clips shorter than 5 seconds were discarded to avoid blank audio segments and
                            insufficient data.
                    \item Clips between 5 and 10 seconds were padded with silence at the end to
                            standardize their length to 10 seconds.
                \end{itemize}
        
            \item \textbf{Augmentation Techniques:}
                To balance the dataset, augmentation techniques such as time stretching, phase shifting, and noise addition were applied. The parameters were varied to ensure diversity in the augmented data.
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Each bird class was augmented to contain exactly 500 audio clips.
                \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
        
        

        % Data Preprocessing
        \subsection{Data Preprocessing}
        The audio recordings were transformed into Mel Spectrograms for further
        analysis.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Conversion Details:}
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Audio files were converted using a sample rate of 32,000 Hz.
                    \item The spectrograms were generated with a Hanning window and 48 Mel bands.
                \end{itemize}

            \item \textbf{Dataset Expansion:}
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Each audio file was converted into corresponding Mel
                            Spectrogram images for CNN based models and MFCC vectors for LSTM based model.
                    \item The resulting dataset was divided into training, validation, and testing sets
                            for model development.
                \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize} 

      \subsection{Feature Extraction}
      The Mel Spectrogram was employed to transform raw audio recordings into a two-dimensional time-frequency representation, effectively converting sound into an image-like format for processing by convolutional neural networks. This method captures both the temporal and spectral nuances of bird calls, allowing the classifier to discern distinguishing features among various species. As demonstrated in the work of Sevilla et al.\cite{sevilla2017audio}, such time-frequency representations enhance classification accuracy by emphasizing key frequency components inherent in bird vocalizations.

      For a more detailed discussion on the Mel Spectrograms, please refer to the \ref{sec:feature_extraction}.

      
      \subsection{Model Architecture}

      The bird call classification model is based on EfficientNetB3, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for optimal efficiency and accuracy. EfficientNetB3 achieves this through \textbf{compound scaling}, which uniformly scales network depth, width, and resolution to maximize performance while minimizing computational cost.
      
      \subsubsection{EfficientNetB3}
      EfficientNetB3 is part of the EfficientNet family, which employs a balance between deeper layers, wider networks, and higher input resolutions. This architecture integrates several enhancements, including \textbf{Mobile Inverted Bottleneck Convolution (MBConv) blocks}, \textbf{squeeze-and-excitation (SE) modules}, and the \textbf{Swish activation function}. These components contribute to better feature extraction and gradient flow, ensuring robust classification performance.
      \begin{itemize}
      \item[i)] \textbf{Architecture of EfficientNetB3} \\
            EfficientNetB3 follows a hierarchical feature extraction process, where early layers detect fundamental patterns (edges, textures), while deeper layers extract more complex features. The architecture consists of multiple MBConv blocks that improve computational efficiency by using \textbf{depthwise separable convolutions} and \textbf{linear bottlenecks}. Additionally, SE modules dynamically recalibrate channel-wise feature responses, enhancing the modelâ€™s ability to focus on important frequency patterns in the mel spectrogram.
            The key architectural components of EfficientNetB3 are summarized below:
            \begin{itemize}
                  \item \textbf{Convolutional Layers:} Extract spatial features from input spectrograms. Early layers capture basic patterns such as edges and textures. Deeper layers learn abstract audio representations.

                  \item \textbf{MBConv Blocks:} .Mobile Inverted Bottleneck Convolution blocks enhance efficiency. Utilize depthwise separable convolutions to reduce computational cost. Incorporate linear bottlenecks to maintain feature representation.

                  \item \textbf{Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) Modules:} Improve feature recalibration by dynamically adjusting channel-wise feature responses, allowing the network to focus on relevant frequency patterns.
                  
                  \item \textbf{Swish Activation:} A smooth, non-monotonic activation function that enhances gradient flow and optimization stability.
                  
                  \item \textbf{Batch Normalization:} Standardizes activations at each layer to stabilize training and improve convergence.
                  
                  \item \textbf{Global Average Pooling:} Reduces dimensionality of feature maps before passing them to the classification layer.
                  
                  \item \textbf{Dropout Layer:} A dropout of 0.3 is applied to prevent overfitting by randomly deactivating neurons.
                  
                  \item \textbf{Fully Connected Layer:} Converts extracted features into classification outputs.
                  
                  \item \textbf{Softmax Activation:} Probability distributions for multi-class classification.

            % \subsubsection{Adaptation for Bird Call Classification}
      \item[ii)] \textbf{Adaptation for Bird Call Classification} \\
            While EfficientNetB3 is originally designed for image classification, it has been adapted for bird call classification by processing mel spectrograms as input. The key modifications include:
            
            \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Input Modification:} The model accepts spectrogram inputs with dimensions \(128 \times 128 \times 3\), where three channels correspond to different spectrogram augmentations or frequency bands.
            \item \textbf{Feature Extraction:} The EfficientNetB3 layers pre-trained on ImageNet are used as a feature extractor. The convolutional layers are \textbf{frozen} to retain general visual features while training the classification head on bird call data.
            \item \textbf{Custom Classification Head:} The original fully connected layers are replaced with a new classification head consisting of a \textbf{Flatten} layer, \textbf{Dropout} layer (0.3), and a \textbf{Dense} layer. A softmax activation function is applied to generate class probabilities.
            \end{itemize}
            

      \item[iii)] \textbf{Training and Generalization} \\
            The model is trained using a transfer learning approach, where only the classification layers are updated while the pre-trained EfficientNetB3 layers remain frozen. This reduces training time and improves generalization.

                  \item \textbf{Loss Function:}
                  Categorical Cross-Entropy(CCE) was chosen as the loss function since it is well-suited for multi-class classification tasks. The Categorical Cross-Entropy is calculated as:
                  % \begin{equation}
                  \begin{eqnarray}
                        L_{CCE} = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{j=1}^{C} y_{i,j} \log(\hat{y}_{i,j})
                  \end{eqnarray}
                        where N is Number of data samples and C is number of Classes.
                  
                  % \end{equation}

                  \begin{itemize}
                  \item Dropout (0.3) was applied to prevent overfitting.
                  \item L2 regularization (\(\lambda = 1e^{-4}\)) was used for additional weight regularization.
                  \end{itemize}

                  \item Training and validation losses were monitored each epoch.
                  \item Learning rate adjustments were made using an exponential decay function.
                  \item Early stopping was implemented with a patience of three epochs to prevent overfitting.
                  \item Model checkpointing was applied to save the best-performing model based on validation loss.

            The final model efficiently classifies bird calls by leveraging deep feature extraction from EfficientNetB3 while incorporating a custom classification head optimized for spectrogram data. Through transfer learning and regularization techniques, the model generalizes well to new audio samples, achieving high classification accuracy.
      \end{itemize}


      \subsubsection{CNN+LSTM Model}
      The CNN+LSTM architecture is designed for bird call classification using MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) matrices instead of mel spectrogram images. Unlike EfficientNetB3, which processes image representations of audio, this model extracts both spatial and temporal features by combining convolutional layers with recurrent layers.

    \subsection{Evaluation Metrics}
        To assess the performance of the proposed models, the following evaluation metrics were used. These metrics provide a comprehensive understanding of the models classification ability by analyzing both correct predictions and class-wise performance.
        
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Accuracy:}  
            Accuracy measures the overall correctness of the model by calculating the ratio of correctly classified samples to the total number of samples.
            \begin{equation}
                Accuracy = \frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN}
            \end{equation}
        
            \item \textbf{Recall:}  
            Recall (also known as sensitivity or true positive rate) measures the model's ability to correctly identify positive instances.
            \begin{equation}
                Recall = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}
            \end{equation}
        
            \item \textbf{Precision:}  
            Precision quantifies the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of all predicted positive instances.
            \begin{equation}
                Precision = \frac{TP}{TP + FP}
            \end{equation}
        
            \item \textbf{F1-score:}  
            The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure when there is an uneven class distribution.
            \begin{equation}
                F1\text{-}score = 2 \times \frac{Precision \times Recall}{Precision + Recall}

        \end{itemize}
      

% Feature Extraction
\section{Feature Extraction}
\label{sec:feature_extraction} 
Feature extraction was a critical step where the audio clips were transformed
into a format that were fed into machine learning models. We used two primary
techniques for feature extraction: Mel Spectrograms and Mel-Frequency Cepstral
Coefficients (MFCC).

      \subsection{Mel Spectrogram}
      A spectrogram is a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies in a
      sound signal as they vary with time. It is generated by applying the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) to the audio signal, followed by mapping the frequencies to the Mel scale, which better represents human auditory perception. This transformation provides
      insight into how the frequency content of the signal changes over time.

      \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT):} The STFT is computed by dividing the signal into overlapping frames, applying a window function, and then performing the Fourier Transform on each frame.
        \begin{eqnarray}
            X(n) = \sum_{m=0}^{N-1} x(m) \cdot w(n-m)
            \end{eqnarray}
      
            where \( x(m) \) is the audio signal and \( w(n) \) is the window function.
        \item \textbf{Mel Scale Transformation:}
        The frequency axis of the spectrogram is then mapped to the Mel scale using triangular filter banks.
        \begin{eqnarray}
            M(f) = 2595 \log_{10} \left(1 + \frac{f}{700} \right)
            \end{eqnarray}
      
            where \( M(f) \) is the Mel frequency, and f is the frequency in Hz.
            
        \item \textbf{Log Scaling and Normalization:}
        Convert Mel spectrogram to a logarithmic scale:
        \begin{eqnarray}
            S_{\text{log}}(m, n) = \log \left( S_{\text{mel}}(m, n) \right)
            \end{eqnarray}
            where \( S_{\text{log}}(m, n) \) is the log-scaled Mel spectrogram, and \( S_{\text{mel}}(m, n) \) is the Mel spectrogram before log transformation.
      \end{enumerate}

            \caption{Mel Spectrogram image for a sample audio}
            \label{fig:mel_spectrogram_sample}
      \end{figure}

      \newpage
      
      \subsection{Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC)}
      MFCCs are coefficients that collectively describe the short-term power spectrum
      of a sound signal. The process of obtaining MFCCs involves several steps:
      \begin{figure}[h!]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/MFCC.jpg}
            \caption{Feature Extraction Using Spectrogram and
                  MFCC}%\label{fig:fig1}
      \end{figure}
      
      \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Framing:} Divide the audio signal into short frames.
            \item \textbf{Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT):} Convert each frame to the
                  frequency domain.
                  \begin{eqnarray}
                        X(k) = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x(n) \cdot e^{-j \frac{2\pi}{N} kn}
                  \end{eqnarray}

            \item \textbf{Log Function:} Apply a logarithm to the amplitude spectrum.
                  \begin{eqnarray}
                        S_{\text{log}}(k) = \log(|X(k)|)
                  \end{eqnarray}

            \item \textbf{Mel-Scaling:} Map the frequencies to the Mel scale, which
                  better represents how humans perceive sound.
                  \begin{eqnarray}
                        f_{\text{mel}} = 2595 \cdot \log_{10}(1 + \frac{f}{700})
                  \end{eqnarray}

            \item \textbf{Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT):} Convert the Mel spectrum to
                  the cepstral domain, yielding the MFCC features.
                  \begin{eqnarray}
                        C(n) = \sum_{k=0}^{K-1} S_{\text{mel}}(k) \cdot \cos \left(
                        \frac{\pi n (k+0.5)}{K} \right)
                  \end{eqnarray}

      \end{enumerate}

% Genetic Algorithm
\section{Hyperparameter Optimization using Genetic Algorithm}
Genetic algorithms are a powerful method for optimizing hyperparameters
in machine learning models. Genetic Algorithm have proven to significantly
improve the performance metrics of the CNN model instead of using hand tuned
approach for hyperparameters. This section outlines the steps involved in using
GAs for hyperparameter optimization\cite{9058307}.
\begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Encoding the Hyperparameters}
            \begin{itemize}
                  \item Hyperparameters are represented as a chromosome, where each hyperparameter is a
                        gene in the chromosome.
                  \item For example, in a neural network, a chromosome might include genes for the
                        learning rate, number of layers, number of neurons per layer, and activation
                        functions.
            \end{itemize}

      \item \textbf{Initial Population}
            \begin{itemize}
                  \item An initial population of chromosomes is generated randomly, with each
                        chromosome representing a different set of hyperparameters.
            \end{itemize}

      \item \textbf{Fitness Function}
            \begin{itemize}
                  \item A fitness function is defined to evaluate the performance of each set of
                        hyperparameters.
                  \item This typically involves training the model with the given hyperparameters and
                        measuring its performance on a validation set.
            \end{itemize}
      \\
      \item \textbf{Selection}
            \begin{itemize}
                  \item Selection involves choosing the best-performing chromosomes to serve as parents
                        for the next generation.
                  \item Various selection methods can be employed, such as tournament selection,
                        roulette wheel selection, or rank-based selection.
            \end{itemize}
            
      \item \textbf{Crossover (Recombination)}
            \begin{itemize}
                  \item Crossover combines pairs of parent chromosomes to produce offspring for the
                        next generation.
                  \item This is done by swapping segments of parent chromosomes to create new
                        chromosomes, thereby combining features of both parents.
            \end{itemize}

      \item \textbf{Mutation}
            \begin{itemize}
                  \item Mutation introduces random changes to some of the genes in the offspring
                        chromosomes.
                  \item This helps maintain genetic diversity in the population and allows the
                        algorithm to explore a broader search space.
            \end{itemize}

      \item \textbf{Replacement}
            \begin{itemize}
                  \item The current population is partially or entirely replaced with the new
                        generation of chromosomes, ensuring that better solutions are carried forward
                        while allowing for exploration of new possibilities.
            \end{itemize}

      \item \textbf{Termination}
            \begin{itemize}
                  \item The process of selection, crossover, mutation, and replacement is repeated
                        until a termination criterion is met.
                  \item This could be a set number of generations, convergence of fitness scores, or
                        achieving a satisfactory performance level.
            \end{itemize}

      \item \textbf{Best Solution}
            \begin{itemize}
                  \item The best chromosome at the end of the process represents the optimal or
                        near-optimal set of hyperparameters for the model.
            \end{itemize}

\section{Software Development Model}
This project will be using an incremental methodology since it offers a
functioning prototype at an early stage of development. The requirements and
scope of the project can be altered as necessary by studying the prototype. The
rationale for the preference for this software development strategy is the
flexibility offered by adopting the incremental technique. In this paradigm,
the project goes through several releases or iterations prior to its official
release.

\chapter{Results and Analysis}
In the course of our project on Bird Species Classification from Audio, we have
accomplished several key tasks to progress our analysis and model development:

\section{Bird Sound Detection}

Figure \ref{fig:training_curves} shows the training progress over 15 epochs. The model shows consistent improvement in both accuracy and loss metrics during training and validation phases.

\begin{figure}[h!]
      \centering
      \begin{subfigure}{\textwidth}
            \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/det_acc.png}
            \caption{Accuracy curves}

      \end{subfigure}
      \caption{Training and validation curves for Bird Sound Detection Model}
      \label{fig:training_curves}
\end{figure}

The training process exhibited steady improvement, with the model achieving final metrics of:
\begin{itemize}
      \item Training accuracy: \textbf{84.20\%} and validation accuracy: \textbf{84.10\%}
            \item Training loss: \textbf{0.394} and validation loss: \textbf{0.412}
            \item Training F1-score: \textbf{0.585} and validation F1-score: \textbf{0.615}
      \end{itemize}

The close alignment between training and validation metrics indicates good generalization without overfitting. The loss curves show consistent convergence, while accuracy and F1-scores demonstrate steady improvement throughout the training process.

The confusion matrix in Figure \ref{fig:Confusion Matrix for Detection Model} shows the classification performance on the test dataset. From the total of \textbf{1621} samples, the model correctly classified \textbf{621} samples as non-bird sounds (True Negatives) and \text{680} samples as bird sounds (True Positives). There were 107 false positives and \textbf{160} false negatives.

\chapter{Discussion}
The project on bird species identification from audio recordings has yielded promising results, demonstrating the efficacy of advanced machine learning techniques in bioacoustic analysis. Our approach involved the development of two primary models: a bird sound detection model based on a modified ResNet-50 architecture and a bird species classification model utilizing EfficientNetB3 and CNN-LSTM architectures. The bird sound detection model achieved an impressive accuracy of 82.97\%, with an AUC score of 0.911, indicating its strong ability to distinguish bird sounds from background noise. This model's performance underscores the importance of robust feature extraction and data augmentation techniques in handling diverse and noisy audio environments. On the other hand, the bird species classification model, particularly the EfficientNetB3 architecture, demonstrated superior performance with an accuracy of 90.73\% and an F1-score of 91\%. This high level of accuracy highlights the model's capability to effectively classify a wide range of bird species based on their vocalizations. The use of genetic algorithms for hyperparameter optimization further enhanced the models' performance, showcasing the potential of evolutionary algorithms in fine-tuning complex neural networks. We found that Mel-Spectrograms are best suited for CNN-based architectures, while MFCCs are more effective for RNN-based models. Additionally, the EfficientNetB3 model outperformed the CNN-LSTM model, indicating that compound scaling in neural networks can significantly improve classification accuracy. Overall, this project represents a significant step forward in the application of machine learning to avian bioacoustics, offering valuable tools for conservation efforts, biodiversity monitoring, and ecological research.

\section{Limitations}
\begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Dataset Limitations:} While the dataset provides a solid foundation, it has limitations in species diversity, environmental noise, and recording conditions. These factors affect the model's accuracy when applied to new or less-represented bird species. Overrepresentation of certain species has led to biased predictions, making identification less reliable for species with fewer training samples.
      \item \textbf{Multiple Bird Sounds:} The system is designed to recognize a single dominant bird call in an audio recording. When multiple birds vocalize simultaneously, the model may misclassify calls or overlook background species, reducing accuracy in complex soundscapes.
      \item \textbf{Internet Dependency:} The prediction process requires an active internet connection since the model runs on a cloud-based service. Limited or no connectivity may prevent users from accessing real-time predictions.
\end{itemize}

\section{Future Improvements}
\begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Enhanced Dataset:} Expanding the dataset to include more diverse bird species and recording conditions will improve the model's generalization and accuracy. Collaborating with ornithologists and bird enthusiasts to gather more data can help achieve this goal.
      \item \textbf{Multi-Bird Sound Recognition:} Developing algorithms to handle multiple overlapping bird calls in a single recording will enhance the system's robustness in real-world scenarios. Techniques such as source separation and advanced signal processing can be explored.
      \item \textbf{Offline Functionality:} Implementing offline capabilities in the mobile application will allow users to record and analyze bird sounds without requiring an internet connection. This can be achieved by integrating a lightweight version of the model directly into the app.
      \item \textbf{User Feedback Integration:} Incorporating user feedback mechanisms to validate and improve predictions can enhance the system's accuracy over time. Users can provide corrections or additional information about the identified species, contributing to continuous model improvement.
      \item \textbf{Real-Time Processing:} Optimizing the model for real-time processing will enable instant identification of bird species during field observations. This can be particularly useful for bird watchers and researchers in remote locations.
